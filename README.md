Here's an overview of the functions provided by the `datetime` and `time` modules, which you can include in your `README.md` file on GitHub.

# Date and Time Functions in Python

## Overview

Python provides powerful modules for handling dates and times: `datetime` and `time`. These modules allow you to work with dates, times, and time intervals. Below is a detailed explanation of the functions available in each module.

---

## `datetime` Module

The `datetime` module provides classes for manipulating dates and times. The key classes in the module are `date`, `time`, `datetime`, and `timedelta`.

### 1. `datetime.date`

- **`date(year, month, day)`**: Creates a date object.
- **`today()`**: Returns the current local date.
- **`fromtimestamp(timestamp)`**: Returns a date object from a POSIX timestamp.
- **`weekday()`**: Returns the day of the week as an integer, where Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6.
- **`isoformat()`**: Returns the date in ISO 8601 format (`YYYY-MM-DD`).

### 2. `datetime.time`

- **`time(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)`**: Creates a time object.
- **`isoformat()`**: Returns the time in ISO 8601 format (`HH:MM:SS.mmmmmm`).

### 3. `datetime.datetime`

- **`datetime(year, month, day, hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)`**: Combines date and time into a single object.
- **`now()`**: Returns the current local date and time.
- **`utcnow()`**: Returns the current UTC date and time.
- **`combine(date, time)`**: Combines a `date` object and a `time` object into a `datetime` object.
- **`strptime(date_string, format)`**: Parses a string into a `datetime` object based on the format.
- **`strftime(format)`**: Returns a string representing the date and time, controlled by an explicit format string.

### 4. `datetime.timedelta`

- **`timedelta(days=0, seconds=0, microseconds=0, milliseconds=0, minutes=0, hours=0, weeks=0)`**: Represents the difference between two dates or times.
- **`total_seconds()`**: Returns the total number of seconds contained in the duration.

### 5. `datetime.tzinfo`

- **`tzinfo()`**: Base class for dealing with time zones.
- **`utcoffset()`**: Returns the offset of the local time from UTC.
- **`dst()`**: Returns the daylight saving time (DST) adjustment.

### 6. `datetime.timezone`

- **`timezone(offset, name=None)`**: Creates a timezone object representing a fixed offset from UTC.

## `time` Module

The `time` module provides time-related functions, including handling system time and delays.

### 1. Time Retrieval

- **`time()`**: Returns the current time as a floating-point number expressed in seconds since the epoch.
- **`ctime([secs])`**: Converts a time expressed in seconds since the epoch to a string representing local time.
- **`gmtime([secs])`**: Converts seconds since the epoch to a `struct_time` in UTC.
- **`localtime([secs])`**: Converts seconds since the epoch to a `struct_time` in local time.
- **`strftime(format[, t])`**: Converts a `struct_time` or tuple representing a time as returned by `gmtime()` or `localtime()` to a string as specified by the format argument.
- **`strptime(string, format)`**: Parses a string representing a time according to a format.
- **`mktime(t)`**: Converts a `struct_time` in local time to seconds since the epoch.

### 2. Time Management

- **`sleep(secs)`**: Suspends execution of the calling thread for the given number of seconds.
- **`time_ns()`**: Returns the current time in nanoseconds.

### 3. Performance Counter

- **`perf_counter()`**: Returns the value (in fractional seconds) of a performance counter, which includes time elapsed during sleep.
- **`monotonic()`**: Returns the value (in fractional seconds) of a monotonic clock, i.e., a clock that cannot go backwards.
- **`process_time()`**: Returns the processor time or CPU time used by the current process.

### 4. Utility Functions

- **`asctime([t])`**: Converts a `struct_time` or tuple representing a time as returned by `gmtime()` or `localtime()` to a string of the form "Sun Jun 20 23:21:05 1993".
- **`timezone`**: The difference in seconds between UTC and local standard time.

## Usage Examples

```python
import datetime

# Getting the current date and time
now = datetime.datetime.now()

# Creating a date object
my_date = datetime.date(2023, 9, 4)

# Adding 5 days to the current date
new_date = now + datetime.timedelta(days=5)

import time

# Getting the current time in seconds since the epoch
current_time = time.time()

# Sleeping for 2 seconds
time.sleep(2)
```

## Conclusion

Both the `datetime` and `time` modules offer robust functionality for working with dates and times in Python. Understanding these modules can help you handle any time-related task in your projects.
